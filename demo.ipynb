Almost all episodes ended with a variation of the title of the series spoken as the answer to a question posed by the same character, Jim Hacker. Several episodes were adapted for BBC Radio, and a stage play was produced in 2010, the latter leading to a new television series on UKTV Gold in 2013.\""
